* **Use of Social media has been increasing day by day among people. Along with that, hate speech among users especially in a platform like Twitter is also increasing. So it is a tough challenge for companies to monitor each and every tweet of users.** <br>
I developed a machine learning model to identify the hate speech tweets automatically which saves lot of resources for companies. <br>
In this problem, the data set given has only 25% of hate tweets, so when I built the model using this data,the model performs better on the normal tweets which doesn't solve our problem. So i had to oversample the hate tweets so that the two classes will be equal and the model works better.
