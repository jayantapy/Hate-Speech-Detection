* **Use of Social media has been increasing day by day among people. Along with that, hate speech among users especially in a platform like Twitter is also increasing. So it is a tough challenge for companies to monitor each and every tweet of users.** <br>
* **In this project, I developed a machine learning model to identify the hate speech tweets automatically.<br>**
* **The biggest problem which I faced was that the Twitter data set had only 25% of hate tweets, so when I built the model using this data,the model performs better on the normal tweets as well which doesn't solve our objective. So I had to oversample the hate tweets so that the two classes will have equal number of count and the model works better.**
